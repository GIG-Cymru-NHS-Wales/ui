## Benefits for our organization

Bits UI is headless. #

- What this means is our organization's UI/UX team have full power to make Bits UI look like whatever we want, such as by leveraging health care design systems by NHS England. Simultaneously, Bits UI handles accessibility issues and cross-browser issues; this is especially important for more-complex controls such as a calendar picker. 

- For comparison, the NHS England design system is not headless. There is tight coupling between the semantic purpose (e.g. calendar picker) and the display settings (e.g. black header). This makes it harder to change, for example if our UI/UX team wants to use a calendar picker with a blue header).

- Bits UI is integration-ready for Figma.

- What this means is our organization can continue to use Figma, and can easily add in Bits UI, and add in our organization's UI/UX design system.

- For comparison, the NHS England design system is not integration-ready for Figma. As far as we know, the NHS England UI/UX team didn't prioritize Figma nor any other low-code no-code solutions such as Figma.

Bits UI targets the Svelte web framework.

- What this means is our organization can aim for Svelte for our upskilling, because Svelte is especially-friendly for developers and testers. This is because Svelte uses popular web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and deliberately does not use any use any technology from mega-commercial U.S. companies such as React technology by Facebook or Blazor technology by Microsoft. 

- For comparison, the NHS England design system uses "nunjucks" with is not popular, not well-supported, not well-maintained, and not compatible with Svelte nor React nor Blazor.

If any of our projects do want to use those mega-commercial technologies, then the baseline of Svelte makes it especially easy to code-shift into any target technologies. The design systems from NHS England and GOV.UK are not built for Svelte.

Bits UI emphasizes the use of AI 

- What this means is Bits UI provides an AI context file called "llm.txt" that teaches an AI code assistant how to use Bits UI. This makes it faster and easier for our for our staff to create code, test it, and maintain it. Notably, the AI and context file make easier to framework-shift code as needed, such as if one of our project teams wants to framework-shift the code from Svelte into React by Facebook or Blazor by Microsoft.

- For comparison, the NHS England design system does not provide AI context files, so there's no simple way to teach AI code assistants how to use the NHS England design system.
 
## Our organization goals

Joel is aiming for Bits UI headless components for Svelte to become a way for our organization to upskill our software staff, including our designers, developers, testers, and the like.

Joel is working on the Welsh Authentication (WAuth) pilot project for an authentication front door, that we can reuse among multiple application that we develop. 

- The first of these applications is the Welsh Ugent Emergency Care (WUEC) project, also known as the Emergency Department Module (EDM). The emergency context has many atypical UI/UX issues, including for very fast authentication and during very high dynamic events.

 -WUEC is the leading edge of the first two sentences in our organization's Integrated Medium Term Plan (IMTP). Our IMTP is a key planning document used by health boards and other organizations in NHS Wales to outline their strategic priorities and planned activities over a three-year periodmedium term plan IMTP, meaning the vision and mission.

- For context, Welsh Auth is the work in progress for a new "front door" that will connect to our internal MS365 CoE, functioning as our shared library for our projects.

Joel is seeking commericial budget to hire a Bits UI expert developer consultant for a short-term one-time project to build more Bits UI components that are specific identified needs for our design system, including any that we want to leverage from NHS England. 

- For our IMTP strategic mission, this speaks to bullet points 1 and 2, because we're aiming to create digital components for Welsh Authentication, then extend these to all our digital development. There are many aspects included in this, because a good design system will flow throughout everything we develop.
