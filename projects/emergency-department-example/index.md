## Scenario

The following scenario was developed based on the existing medical procedures and the most frequently encountered task lists 

Patient was brought to the hospital ED as a victim of a car accident. Patient has been complaining from extreme pain.

Patient was taken to bed number 10 at the ED. According to their identification
card, they were born in (city) on (date), and their mobile phone number is
(phone).

Patient is currently suffering from dyspnoea and nose bleeding. They had an
operation from her stomach because of gastric bleeding previously. They have
emphysema in the lungs due to addiction to alcohol and smoking. They have been
smoking 10 cigarettes per day on average and also has been using 100 mg of
aspirin 3 times a day to avoid arteriosclerosis. In the family, cancer has been
seen.

Vital information is blood pressure 160 mmHg with a systolic value and 120 mmHg
diastolic value, pulse 90, fever 39 °C, respiration rate 50 and oxygen
saturation 90%, respectively. 

## Tasks

Nurse tasks:

* Insert patient’s identification information

* Define the patient triage scale (hardness of the pain)

* List patient complaints

* Identify arrival reason(s) (e.g. traffic accident, injury, suicide and intoxication)

* Ask patient’s allergy to any medicine (e.g. penicillin)

* Query any previous diseases and surgeries

* Ask addictions (e.g. smoking, alcohol and drugs)

* Ask functional deficiencies (e.g. movement, hearing and talking, visual difficulties)

* Query nutrition, mood, still used medicine and genetic family diseases

* Measure vital symptoms of patient (e.g. blood pressure, pulse, fever, respiration number and saturation parameters)

* Define pain (e.g. scale, type, starting time, location, frequency, increasing and decreasing conditions)

* Note nurse observations

Physician tasks:

* Control patient complaints (e.g. stomach ache, traumas, falling, fainting, vomiting, fever and chest ache) and add new complaints if necessary

* Fill the patient story

* Check the patient family information and add new information, if necessary

* Add observational notes

* Place pre-diagnosis

* Order inspection(s)

* Fulfill pre-treatment procedures

* Check patient vital symptoms and nurse observations note

* Examine the inspections (e.g. laboratory results)

* Determine the treatment plan and apply

## Nielsen’s ten factor for usability evaluation

* Visibility of system status

* Match between the system and the real world
  
* Consistency and standards

* User control and freedom

* Error prevention

* Recognition rather than recall

* Flexibility and efficiency of use

* Esthetic and minimalist design
* Help users to recognize, to diagnose and to recover from errors

* Help and documentation

## Satisfaction metrics

Items used to measure user satisfaction:

* The interface sizes are helpful for information entry

* The interfaces help during the information entry

* The program flow helped me

* Information entry is practical

* The order of the menu system is helpful to the information entry

* Using the software system is faster than filling the printed ED form

* The order of the menu system is similar to the printed ED form

* Reading and following the form information is faster than reading from papers
